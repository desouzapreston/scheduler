# Scheduler
Dealership POS Scheduler Software Featuring a DataService for dynamic data driven design. 
Website doesn't have a currently landing page so I'm working on a nice layout but the core logic behind the code has more pressing things to be fixed first. 

What's going on with this site:
Authentication
Vehicle List Allows Users To Add To The Database Directly What Car Make/Model/Year They Have In The Lot
Ability to Remove Database Objects From The Front End

What's really missing:
Admin Dashboard - Could easily bootstrap it but I want to make it from scratch
Scheduling Page (in development) to allow multiple users to reserve one vehicle per slot available with no conflicts

This project is in long development due to the client reserving a seperate software service. This meant this project got put kind of on hold. But it will be finished in the near future just for showcase purposes.
